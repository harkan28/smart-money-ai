ai = SmartMoneyAI()

# Part 1: SMS Parsing
result = ai.parse_sms("Paid Rs.2,500 to SWIGGY via UPI...")
batch_result = ai.parse_sms_batch(sms_list)

# Part 2: Expense Categorization
category = ai.categorize_expense("Amazon shopping", 5000)
batch_categories = ai.categorize_expenses_batch(transactions)
manual_tx = ai.add_manual_transaction("Coffee shop", 300)

# Part 3: Savings & Budgeting
savings_analysis = ai.analyze_monthly_savings(user_profile, transactions)
budget_optimization = ai.optimize_budget(user_profile, expenses, savings_goal)
future_savings = ai.predict_future_savings(user_profile, historical_data)

# Part 4: Investment Recommendations
investment_recs = ai.get_investment_recommendations(user_profile, 100000)
gold_analysis = ai.get_gold_investment_analysis(user_profile, 50000)
portfolio_optimization = ai.get_portfolio_optimization(user_profile, current_portfolio, target_amount)

# Comprehensive Analysis
