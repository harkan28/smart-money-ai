## 🚀 **UNIFIED SYSTEM CAPABILITIES**

### 💰 **Core Financial Intelligence**
```python
from smart_money_ai import SmartMoneyAI

ai = SmartMoneyAI()

# Parse SMS transactions
transaction = ai.parse_sms("Spent Rs 2,500 at BigBasket")

# Analyze spending vs 20,000 demographic profiles  
analysis = ai.analyze_spending(user_profile, monthly_expenses)

# Get behavioral investment recommendations
investment_advice = ai.get_investment_recommendations(user_profile)

# Create AI-powered smart budgets
smart_budget = ai.create_smart_budget(user_profile)

# Calculate comprehensive financial health score
health_score = ai.get_financial_health_score(user_profile, expenses, goals)
```

### 📊 **Intelligence Statistics**
- **20,000+ Personal Finance Profiles**: Demographic benchmarking

## 💡 **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### Quick Start
```bash
# Launch the unified system
python main.py

# Run comprehensive demo
python examples/demos/clean_system_demo.py
```

### Smart Money AI Integration
```python
# Initialize once, use everywhere
ai = SmartMoneyAI()

# Complete financial analysis pipeline
user = {'age': 29, 'income': 85000, 'city_tier': 'Tier_1'}
expenses = {'groceries': 6000, 'transport': 4500, 'eating_out': 4000}
goals = {'monthly_investment': 7000, 'goal': 'wealth_generation'}

# Get comprehensive financial intelligence
health_score = ai.get_financial_health_score(user, expenses, goals)
# Result: 75/100 (B+) with specific improvement recommendations
```
